This is the content of dotenv file -
SECRET=secret
JWTSECRET=secret
You clone to your local and see my todo API don't forget to install npm packages.
In this todo API i use JWT token where user can first register and by the help of the token user can login into todo.
In todo user can create our todo , get single and all todo, update our todo , delete our todo.
I check the API through Postman. Hope you like it Thank you.
